/**
 * Directory paths
 *
 * You can also customize the directory locations or the URLs their contents
 * are served under. Each one of the basic three directory types can be
 * configured by defining constants.
 *
 * Example:
 * 	`'/var/www/example.org/htdocs/app/webroot/media/'`
 *
 * Directory Structure
 * -------------------
 * The plugin's components are capable of adapting to custom directory
 * structures by modifying the MEDIA_* path and URL constants. It's
 * recommended (but not required) to use the following structure in combination
 * with the plugin. Components of the plugin are by default expecting it to
 * be organized this way.
 *
 * - webroot/media: The base directory.
 * -- static: Files required by the application.
 * --- doc: Documents i.e. PDF.
 * --- gen: Everything else.
 * --- img: Images.
 * -- filter: Directory holding generated file versions from _static_ or _transfer_.
 * --- xs
 * --- ...other version names...
 * -- transfer; User uploaded files.
 * --- ...
 *
 * The _static_ directory and all it's content must be *readable* by the
 * effective user.  The _filter_ and the _transfer_ directory must be
 * *read/writable* by the effective user.
 *
 * You can initialize the directory structure from the command line with:
 * $ cake media init
 *
 * Transfer Directory
 * ------------------
 * To protect transferred files from becoming a security issue (most exploits
 * don't affect i.e. resized images) or for being able to password protect those
 * files you can use the following methods.
 *
 * 1. Put a .htaccess file in the directory (in case you're using Apache).
 *    {{{
 *      # webroot/media/transfer/.htaccess
 *      Order deny,allow
 *      Deny from all
 *    }}}
 *
 * 2. Create the .htaccess file from the shell with:
 *    $ cake media protect
 *
 * 3. Relocate the transfer directory by defining the following constants.
 *    The first definition points to the new location of the directory, the second
 *    disables generation of URLs for files below the transfer directory.
 *    {{{
 *        define('MEDIA_TRANSFER', APP . 'transfer' . DS);
 *        define('MEDIA_TRANSFER_URL', false);
 *    }}}
 *
 * @see MediaHelper::webroot()
